# Viu
Virtual design for models for vision impairement users.

Do not look in this repository (so far there is only
garbage in it). By mid-September 2021 there should some
3D models ready.

# Pythagorean theorem (under construction)

This is a virtual prototype of a 3D printed model that demonstrates
a visual proof of Pythagorean theorem. Its general layout is similar
to the 15 puzzle game. Instead of 15 squares there are 4 right
triangles that can slide inside a frame. The triangles can be moved
in a way to recreate the proof of the theorem. The model can be used
to demonstrate other geometrical relations, like areas of parallelograms.

### TODO

* restrict motion base on colission
* add horizontal grooves for tile vertices
* add braille notations
