# Viu
Virtual design for models for vision impairement users.

Note! Do not look in this repository (so far there is only
garbage in it). By mid-September 2021 there should some
3D models ready.

# About

These models are build for the National Scientific Program
"Information and Communication Technologies in Science,
Education and Security" (ICTinSES) financed by the Ministry
of Education and Science.

# Pythagorean theorem

This is a virtual prototype of a 3D printed model that demonstrates
a visual proof of Pythagorean theorem. Its general layout is similar
to the 15 puzzle game. Instead of 15 squares there are 4 right
triangles that can slide inside a frame. The triangles can be moved
in a way to recreate the proof of the theorem.

The right trangle shape is configurable. Here are three versions of the same model:

The model can be used
to demonstrate other geometrical relations, like areas of parallelograms.
