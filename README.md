# Viu
Virtual design for models for vision impairement users.

Note! Do not look in this repository (so far there is only
garbage in it). By mid-September 2021 there should some
3D models ready.

# About

These models are build for the National Scientific Program
"Information and Communication Technologies in Science,
Education and Security" (ICTinSES) financed by the Ministry
of Education and Science.

# Pythagorean theorem

This is a virtual prototype of a 3D printed model that demonstrates
a visual proof of Pythagorean theorem. Its general layout is similar
to the 15 puzzle game. Instead of 15 squares there are 4 right
triangles that can slide inside a frame. The triangles can be moved
in a way to recreate the proof of the theorem.

The right trangle shape is configurable. Here are three versions of the same model:

Apart from demonstrating a visual and tactile proof of the Pythagorean theorem,
the application can be used to demonstrate or explore:

- Area of parallelograms;
- Garden of Eden puzzles;
- Similar right triangles;    
- Second degree equations.



# Papers

The models &ndash; design and applications are discussed in several papers and presented in several conferences:

- "Designing 3D-printer Models for Students with Vision Impairment or Low Vision" (pending review).
- "Virtual Prototypes of 3D Models for Students with Visual Impairment or Low Vision" (under construction).
